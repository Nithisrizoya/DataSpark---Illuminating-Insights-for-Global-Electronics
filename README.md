# Approach:

**Data Cleaning and Preparation**

Checking for missing values and handle them appropriately. Converting data types where necessary (e.g., dates, numerical values). Merging datasets where necessary for analysis (e.g., linking sales data with product and customer data).

**Load Data**

Inserting the preprocessed data into an SQL database by creating relevant tables for each data source.

**Power BI Visualization**

Connecting SQL to Power BI/Tableau, import the data, and create interactive dashboards.

**Develop SQL Queries**

Formulating and executing SQL and Dax queries to extract key insights from the data.

# Analysis Steps:

# 1. Customer Analysis
**Gender Analysis:**
      We can see the male customers are dominating in number when compared to female.
      Female targeted advertisements can help us fight this imbalance and grow overall sales.

**Age Analysis:**
     The customers are bucketed based on their age and then visualised using the bar chart.
      We can see that the people above 65 years are higher in counts than others
